Creating a new timesheet  
   1. If you are a manager, you will be asked the employee ID for the person you want to create a timesheet for. 
      If not, you will not see this question.
   2. Date 
       - It needs to be within the current week
       - Accepted formats are DD/MM/YYYY or DD.MM.YYYY
    1. Start working time
       - Accepted format is HH:MM (24h)
    2. Finish working time
       - Accepted format is HH:MM (24h)
    3. Leave (type 'n' if not applicable and this step will be skipped)
       - Select type of leave you want to apply
       - Enter how many minutes you want to allocate to the leave
    4. Confirmation
       - Type 'y' to confirm or 'n' to restart
       - If confirmed, timesheet will be saved in your file.   

Editing a timesheet  
    Follows same steps of creating a new timesheet. 
    However, when you type a date, the program will look for your existing timesheet for that date. 
    If not found, an error message will be displayed.
